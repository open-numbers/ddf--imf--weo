On the expenditure side, given uncertainties pertaining to the May elections, a slightly slower pace of consolidation than that in the Budget is assumed for FY2016/17 and beyond, though fiscal projections are fully consistent with the fiscal mandates. In addition, IMF staff data exclude public sector banks and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the public sector in April 2012.

Over the medium term, the IMF staff assumes that war drawdown will continue and Congress will continue to make regular adjustments to Medicare payments (DocFix) and will extend certain traditional programs (such as the research and development tax credit).
