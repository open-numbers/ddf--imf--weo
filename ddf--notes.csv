Latest actual data: 2017 Notes: The authorities produce data from 1995 only; Earlier data result from splicing. Base year: 2005 Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data) Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Export and import price indices were calculated according to the Fisher?s, so-called ideal, formula, which is a geometrical mean between the Laspeyres? and Paasche?s formulae. Chain-weighted: No. Export and import price indices are calculated as monthly or quarterly as compared to the base year (previous year). For example, export and import price indices for the first quarter of 2011 are calculated as compared to the period from January to December 2010. Trade System: Special trade. Special ? special trade in a wider sense: processing in customs warehouses and free zones are included. Excluded items in trade: In transit; Low valued; Re-exports; Re-imports. This statistics does not include temporary export and import (less than two years) of goods that are returned to the owner in an unaltered state, services, monetary gold, goods used as carriers of customized information including software and software downloaded from the Internet, means of payment which are legal tender and securities, goods supplied free of charge which are not the subject of commercial transactions (advertising material and commercial samples), supplying of Croatian diplomatic missions abroad and foreign diplomatic missions in the Republic of Croatia, and temporary exports and imports for repair. For 2016, transaction imports below 1.8 million kuna and exports below 0.9 million kuna are exempted from statistical reports. Oil coverage: Primary or unrefined products; Secondary or refined products; Other Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB). The export values are calculated on the basis of the FOB parity. It means that the invoice value is reduced for transportation and other costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery abroad, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is increased by the costs incurred from the place of delivery in Croatia to the Croatian border. Valuation of imports: Cost, insurance, freight (CIF). The import values are calculated on the basis of the CIF parity. It means that the invoice value is increased by transportation and other costs incurred from the place of delivery abroad to the Croatian border, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is reduced for the costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery in Croatia.

pri,ggr,"Source: Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico; and Fiscal and Economic Growth Plan Latest actual data: 2015/16 Notes: Last available fiscal data are from FY 2015/16. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Growth Plans (FEGPs), which were prepared in October 2018, and certified by the Oversight Board. In line with assumptions of this plan, IMF projections assume federal aid for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017. The projections also assume revenue losses from the following: Puerto Rico will lose federal funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) starting in 2020; federal tax incentives, which were neutralizing the effects of Puerto Rico?s Act 154 on foreign companies, will begin to decline starting in 2018; and the effects of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduce tax advantage of U.S. companies producing in Puerto Rico will narrow this revenue base. Given sizable policy uncertainty, some FEGP and IMF assumptions may differ, in particular, those relating to the effects of the corporate tax reform, tax compliance and tax adjustments (fees and rates); reduction of subsidies, freezing of payroll operational costs, improvement of mobility, and reduction of expenses; and increasing health care efficiency. On the expenditure side, measures include extension of Act 66, which freezes much government spending, through 2020; reduction of operating costs; decreases in government subsidies; and spending cuts in education. Although IMF policy assumptions are similar to those in the FEGP scenario with full measures, the IMF?s projections of fiscal revenues, expenditures, and balance are different from FEGP?s. This stems from two main differences in methodologies. First, IMF projections are on an accrual basis, FEGP?s are on a cash basis. Second, the IMF and FEGP make very different macroeconomic assumptions. Start/end months of reporting year: July/June GFS Manual used: Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001 Basis of recording: Accrual. IMF calculations are based on an accrual basis, whereas authorities' calculations are based on a cash basis. General government includes: General government is defined as all general governmental entities, excluding Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA). General government entities include the General Fund, Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority (PRIFA), Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA), Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO), Highways and Transportation Authority (HTA), University of Puerto Rico (UPR), Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico (GDB), and Municipal Revenues Collection Center (CRIM). In addition, pension funds (ERS, TRS, and JRS) are also considered as part of general government. Valuation of public debt: Current market value.

Given sizable policy uncertainty, some FEGP and IMF assumptions may differ, in particular, those relating to the effects of the corporate tax reform, tax compliance and tax adjustments (fees and rates); reduction of subsidies, freezing of payroll operational costs, improvement of mobility, and reduction of expenses; and increasing health care efficiency. On the expenditure side, measures include extension of Act 66, which freezes much government spending, through 2020; reduction of operating costs; decreases in government subsidies; and spending cuts in education. Although IMF policy assumptions are similar to those in the FEGP scenario with full measures, the IMF?s projections of fiscal revenues, expenditures, and balance are different from FEGP?s. This stems from two main differences in methodologies. First, IMF projections are on an accrual basis, FEGP?s are on a cash basis.

Trade volumes are the ratio of the value index to the Fisher unit value index (chain-weighted). The value indices are obtained as the ratio of current values to the arithmetic average of the base year values. Foreign trade indices have been calculated by Eurostat and U.N. concepts and methods. Chain-weighted: Yes, from 2003. Unit value indices are chain-weighted, but volume indices are not. Trade System: Special trade. Relaxed definition. Foreign trade statistics include goods which enter/leave the statistical territory of Turkey from/to other countries and are placed under the customs normal export and import procedures and under customs inward and outward processing procedures. Excluded items in trade: In transit; Low valued; Other. Excluded items include goods valued under $100, transit trade, temporary export/import trade, repair and maintenance of goods, operational leasing, shuttle trade, border trade, some transactions with declaration that are not goods (cash, valuable paper, stamps, monetary gold, etc.).

Note that while Turkstat and the Central Bank of Turkey make estimates on shuttle trade for BOP data, these are not included in the foreign trade statistics disseminated by Turkstat.
